% Sigma tends to enhance the smile's curve, making it steeper. 
% This implies that, in comparison to options with at-the-money strikes, the implied volatility for options with extreme strikes increases.
% The distribution of future stock values has a higher kurtosis when sigma is higher, increasing the likelihood of extreme occurrences, both on the upside and downside. 
% Because of this, implied volatilities for options with extreme strikes are greater. 
% The smile's curve flattens when the vol-of-vol parameter sigma decreases, indicating that the implied volatility for options with extreme strikes is lower than for those at the money.
% This can be seen in the graph,  as we move downwards in each column we can evidence that the curvature of the smile increases(from 0.35 to 1).

%
% The volatility smile becomes more upward-sloping as the rho parameter is raised.
% This is due to the fact that greater rho values indicate a stronger positive connection between the price of the asset and the volatility process.
% As implied volatility tends to be higher when the asset price is higher, the volatility smile has a steeper slope when the asset price is higher. 
% On the other hand, a reduction in the rho parameter tends to make the volatility smile more downward-sloping. 
% This is due to the fact that lower rho values suggest a weaker or negative correlation between the asset price and the volatility process. 
% Because of this, the implied volatility tends to be lower at higher asset prices, creating a flatter slope for the volatility smile.
% This can also be seen in the graph, as we move across the rows, we can evidence the smile moves from downward sloping(-0.2) to smile(0) to upward sloping(0.2)
